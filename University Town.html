          <h2 class="blue-big">Introduction</h2>
          <p class="blog-p">University Town is an RDA-approved housing project developed by Mr. Abdul Aziz Khan, a professor from Peshawar, Pakistan. Moreover, University Town is located on the Kashmir Highway near the Lahore-Islamabad M-2 Motorway Interchange and only 5 minutes away from the Islamabad International Airport.

            You can compare the ecstatic sceneries of this housing society to Park View City, a CDA-approved housing project situated in the Zone IV of Islamabad and Bahria Enclave another prominent housing society with intriguing views. But the prices offered in these societies can be rather hefty on the pocket and not in everyone’s reach. University Town makes it possible for everyone to be able to afford a comfortable living in the midst of a natural environment and lush green areas.

            The housing venture is a phenomenal place to live your life as it will be developed per international standards and equipped with all modern amenities. You will surely witness amazing natural sceneries and breathtaking views of Islamabad, which add to the residential society’s glory.

            Apart from the opulent location, the investment opportunities in society are endless due to a variety of commercial and residential opportunities and cost-effective rates. It is an ideal place for individuals who want to live and raise a family in a neat and clean environment along with the best facilities. So, do not miss this great investment opportunity and book your plots by contacting us at KS Marketing.
